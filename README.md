# LumaX - Light Unification and Manipulation Application

LumaX is a C++ and Qt-based application for astrophotography image processing, inspired by PixInsight. It's designed as a learning project to explore core concepts of astronomical image calibration, registration, and integration.

## Core Features (Planned)

*   **MDI Interface:** Open and manage multiple images in a flexible windowed environment.
*   **FITS & TIFF Support:** Native support for loading 16-bit and 32-bit FITS files, the standard in astrophotography.
*   **Processing Tools:**
    *  GHS - Generalized Hyperbolic Stretch
    *  Histogram Transformation
    *  GraXpert Function
    *  Starnet++ Function
*   **Pre-Processing Tools:**
    *   Image Calibration (Bias, Darks, Flats)
    *   Star Alignment (Registration)
    *   Image Stacking (Integration)
*   **Real-time Previews:** Non-destructive tools like a Screen Transfer Function for immediate visual feedback.
